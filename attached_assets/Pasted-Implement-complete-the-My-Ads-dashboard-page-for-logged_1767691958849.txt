Implement/complete the “My Ads / إعلاناتي” dashboard page for logged-in users so that they can:

View a list/table of their own ads only.

Activate/deactivate each ad using a toggle bound to the published field.

Edit an ad.

Create a new ad.

Use the attached screenshot/recording as a visual reference for the layout and columns.

What I need you to do (step by step)

Locate the existing dashboard ads page

Find the current page/component that corresponds to “My Ads / إعلاناتي” in the dashboard (for example something like /dashboard/ads, /ads/index, or similar).

Do not create a second, duplicate page; extend or refactor the existing one.

Fetch only the current user’s ads

Use the existing auth and data layer (Supabase/Prisma/API calls/etc.) to fetch ads for the logged-in user.

Filter by user_id = currentUser.id (or whatever the equivalent field is in the current schema).

Use the existing data types/models — don’t introduce new fields.

Use loading and error states consistent with the rest of the project.

Render an ads table/list similar to the design
For each ad row, show at least:

Name / title of the ad (e.g. warehouse name).

Address / location.

Availability dates (from/to) if available in the model.

Creation date.

Published status (toggle).

Actions: Edit, maybe Delete.
Use the project’s existing table, button, icon, and toggle components if they exist (to stay consistent with the design system).

Implement the publish toggle (published field)

The active/inactive state should be driven by a boolean field called published.

When the user interacts with the toggle:

Optimistically update the UI.

Call the existing backend/API function to update that ad’s published value.

If the update fails, revert the toggle and show an error message/toast consistent with existing patterns.

Ensure only the owner of the ad can toggle it (rely on existing backend rules where possible).

Wire up Edit and Create actions

Edit:

Add an “Edit / تعديل” button or icon in each row.

When clicked, navigate to the existing edit route for that ad (or create a minimal edit route/component if it doesn’t exist yet and wire it properly).

Create:

Add a prominent “Create Ad / إنشاء إعلان” button in the page header (like in the screenshot).

On click, navigate to the existing “create ad” page/route or open the existing creation flow.

Arabic & English support (RTL/LTR)

Use the existing i18n mechanism in the project; do not invent a new one.

All visible strings on this page must come from translation files / i18n (e.g. myAds.title, myAds.createButton, myAds.columns.name, etc.).

Make sure:

Arabic uses RTL layout and correct labels: “إعلاناتي”, “إنشاء إعلان”, “منشور”, “العنوان”, “تاريخ الإنشاء”, “الإجراءات”, etc.

English uses LTR layout: “My Ads”, “Create Ad”, “Published”, “Address”, “Created At”, “Actions”, etc.

Reuse the same language switch logic already used elsewhere in the app.

Empty, loading, and error states

If the user has no ads, show:

A friendly message (in both languages via i18n).

A clear “Create Ad / إنشاء إعلان” button.

Show a loading indicator while data is being fetched.

Handle errors gracefully with the project’s existing pattern (toast, alert, or inline message).

Style and layout

Make the page look and behave close to the attached screenshot:

Title area: “My Ads / إعلاناتي” + short subtitle explaining that the company’s ads appear here.

Create Ad button positioned appropriately for RTL/LTR.

Table/list below.

Follow the existing styling system (CSS modules, Tailwind, design system, etc.) and keep things responsive.

Code quality

Keep the implementation consistent with the project structure.

If the project uses TypeScript, type the props and API responses properly.

Avoid breaking existing routes or components.

Ensure the project builds with no TypeScript or lint errors.
