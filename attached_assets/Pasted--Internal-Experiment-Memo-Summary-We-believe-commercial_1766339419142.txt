# **Internal Experiment Memo**

## Summary

We believe commercial real estate is fundamentally broken online.

**Commercial real estate still lives offline:** fragmented across brokers, WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and word of mouth. There is no trusted, structured, searchable catalogue, despite strong and obvious demand.

Sirdab Marketplace 2.0 is an experiment to test whether **AI-driven aggregation + a clean catalogue + lightweight transactions** can unlock this market at scale.

This is a 3-month, tightly scoped experiment with clear success metrics.

## Core Thesis

1. **Commercial real estate can be 10x better**
    - Discovery today is slow, manual, and opaque
    - Supply exists, but it is not structured or searchable
2. **Most marketplaces ignore commercial real estate**
    - Residential dominates because it’s easier to aggregate
    - Commercial is more valuable, but harder to standardize
3. **There is no high-quality online catalogue**
    - Users want:
        - Clear pricing
        - Real photos
        - Location clarity
        - Availability
        - Booking and visits
    - Today, none of this exists in one place
4. **AI changes the cost structure of aggregation**
    - Scrapers + agents + WhatsApp outreach allow us to:
        - Aggregate faster
        - Verify cheaper
        - Scale supply without large ops teams

## Context & Learnings So Far

We previously built **marketplace.sirdab.co** primarily as an SEO experiment.

What worked:

- Strong SEO traction
- Consistent inbound demand
- Clear user intent

What didn’t scale:

- Manual aggregation
- Limited listing depth
- No transactions

Key insight:

> Users don’t just want listings.
> 
> 
> They want a **real catalogue** they can actually act on.
> 

This experiment builds on that learning.

## What We’re Testing

By the end of 3 months, we should have clear answers to:

1. Can AI unlock commercial real estate supply at scale?
2. Do users treat Sirdab as a discovery destination?
3. Will people transact through us?
4. Is this a standalone marketplace opportunity?

## Why This Matters (Even If It Fails)

Even in the downside case, we walk away with:

- A strong SEO and content moat
- Reusable AI aggregation infrastructure
- Deep insight into commercial real estate demand
- Optionality to integrate with Sirdab’s core logistics platform

In the upside case:

- This becomes the **default catalogue for commercial real estate**
- High-value transactions
- Strong strategic leverage for Sirdab long-term
