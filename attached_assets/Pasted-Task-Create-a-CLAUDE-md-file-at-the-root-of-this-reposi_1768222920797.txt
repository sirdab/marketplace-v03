Task: Create a CLAUDE.md file at the root of this repository.

Purpose: This file will be used by Claude Code as persistent project context. It must be concise, accurate, and human-readable, and reflect the actual structure, tooling, and workflows of this project.

Instructions:

Scan the entire repository to understand:

Project purpose and architecture

Tech stack, frameworks, and languages used

Package manager and scripts

Folder structure and key files

Environment variables and configuration

Any non-obvious behaviors, conventions, or constraints

Generate a CLAUDE.md file that includes the following sections only if relevant to the project:

Project Overview

One short paragraph describing what this project does and its role in the broader system.

Tech Stack

Languages, frameworks, runtime, package manager, database, infra, and deployment assumptions.

Key Directories & Files

List important folders and files with 1-line explanations (only what matters).

Common Commands

Frequently used bash commands (dev, build, test, lint, migrate, seed, etc.).

Environment & Setup

Required environment variables

How local development is expected to run

Any tooling assumptions (Node version, Python version, pnpm/yarn/npm, etc.).

Code Style & Conventions

Formatting rules

Import style

Naming conventions

Any patterns that should always be followed or avoided.

Workflow Rules

Branching strategy (e.g. main vs feature branches)

Whether to merge or rebase

Commit expectations

PR expectations (if applicable).

Testing & Quality

How tests are run

What must be checked before merging.

Warnings & Gotchas

Any sharp edges, known issues, or things Claude should be careful about.

Do NOT invent tools, commands, or conventions.

If something is unclear or not present in the repo, either omit it or explicitly note it as “not defined.”

Keep it concise.

This is not documentation for humans — it is memory for an AI.

Prefer bullet points over paragraphs.

Output

Create the file as CLAUDE.md

Populate it fully based on actual repository contents

Do not include explanations outside the file itself.

Goal: After this file exists, Claude should be able to start working in this repository with minimal additional clarification.
